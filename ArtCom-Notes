It says your payment has been blocked by your bank, all you'll have to do is ring (call) your bank and get them to authorise the payment.

To boot your pc from a bootable USB you have to restart your pc. Before Windows system will start
you will see a message on your screen "press <the key> to access boot menu" 
(it will disappear quickly so please look carefully). The key is different depending on what 
computer model you have. Once you will press the key instead of the windows logo you will see 
a few options - you have to choose the USB and press enter.

So, if you decide to install it, it will be your responsibility to do so and we would not accept any refunds, 
here is a link to a detailed guide on how to do this, please have a good look through it first before purchasing 
to make sure you are able to perform the installation steps: https://www.howtogeek.com/278953/how-to-install-windows-on-a-chromebook/
